# SSIM - SSIM Simulates Ice Motion

Implementation of the iSOSOA equations describing ice flow (Egholm et. al, 2011) for Nvidia CUDA GPU devices. This implementation was used for the publication (Brædstrup et. al, 2014).

Disclamer
------------
The library is released as is. It was part of a larger program which I am unable to release at this time. The code will therefore not currently run in it's current state. I am releasing it despite this in hope someone might find it useful.
